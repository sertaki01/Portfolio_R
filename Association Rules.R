  # turn data into transaction format
  #transaction format is a data format :each row represent a transaction, each column represent an item and it takes a binary form (1,0) accounting for the presence or abcense of an obeject in the specific tranaction 
  # Apriori is designed to work on transaction format data since it figures out rules for items that frequently co-ccour in transactions 
  #to identify frequently re-occuring item sets, the algorithm calculates support for each possible itemset
  #support in this context being the proportion of transactions, in refference to the total n of transactions that contain the specific itemset
